## Import

It can be added by importing `EditorToolbar` component from `@sparrowengg/twigs-react` and adding it to the editor. By default the toolbar contains the following tools:

- Format tool (headings / paragraph)
- Bold
- Italic
- Underline
- Unordered List
- Ordered List
- Link (Requires `<DialogLinkEditor />` to be added)
- Codeblock
- Inline code
- Text align tool

```tsx
<Editor>
  <EditorToolbar />
</Editor>
```

## Customizing

### Using `tools` prop

The tools shown in the toolbar can be customized by passing the `tools` prop. The prop is an array that can contain the following values: `format`, `bold`, `italic`, `underline`, `unordered-list`, `ordered-list`, `link`, `codeblock`, `code`, `text-align`; it also supports an object in the following format for custom components:

```tsx
{
  renderComponent: (props: { editor: LexicalEditor }) => ReactNode;
}
```

This can be used to change the order of tools or to add custom tools to the toolbar. The `editor` prop is the instance of the editor, and it can be used to interact with the editor.

### Using child components

Components can be directly added as children to the `EditorToolbar` component. You can use the default tools by importing them from `@sparrowengg/twigs-react`.

```tsx
import {
  Editor,
  EditorToolbar,
  BoldTool,
  ItalicTool,
} from "@sparrowengg/twigs-editor-react";
import { Button, Flex } from "@sparrowengg/twigs-react";
```

You can also add custom components to the default tools by passing a `renderButton` prop.

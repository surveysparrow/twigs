## DialogLinkEditor

Link feature is included by default in the editor and it allows you to add hyperlinks. However in order to get the link editor modal, you need to add the `DialogLinkEditor` plugin to the editor.

## ConvertSelectionToLinkOnPastePlugin

This plugin converts the selected text to a link if the pasted text is a URL.

The example below demonstrates both the `DialogLinkEditor` and `ConvertSelectionToLinkOnPastePlugin` working together. You can:

1. **Add links manually**: Use the link tool in the toolbar to add hyperlinks
2. **Convert pasted URLs**: Select text and paste a URL to automatically convert it to a link

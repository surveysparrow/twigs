## Getting started

To get started with Twigs, run the following commands in your project repository terminal.

```bash
npm i @sparrowengg/twigs-react
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Twigs is still in alpha. Please expect breaking changes. We'll try our best to
  make the updates smooth.
</Callout>

Now, you can wrap your application root in Twigs `ThemeProvider`.

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@sparrowengg/twigs-react";

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

The `theme` object in `ThemeProvider` will help you customize the theme settings of your application.
